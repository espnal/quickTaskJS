# Overview

This is a basic API built with Node.js and Express for managing tasks (To-Do lists). It allows you to create, list, and delete tasks using an in-memory database simulation.

GET /tasks → Gets all saved tasks.

POST /tasks → Creates a new task (requires a title in the request body).

DELETE /tasks/:id → Deletes a task by its ID.
